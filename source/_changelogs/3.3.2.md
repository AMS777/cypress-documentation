# 3.3.1

*Released 5/23/2019*

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in {% url "3.3.1" changelog#3-3-1 %} that was causing {% url "`cy.visit()`" visit %} to sometimes hang causing tests to run more slowly. Fixes {% issue 4313 %} and {% issue 4349 %}.
- You can now opt out of sending exceptions to `https://api.cypress.io` by setting `CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS=0` in your system environment variables. {% issue 4386 %}
- The `projectId` in now displayed in the configuration in the Test Runner settings like all other configuration values. Fixes {% issue 4500 %}.
- Special env vars are now truncated in `Cypress.env()` and the debug logs. Addresses {% issue 4501 %}.
- If a site's `content-type` is `null`, `undefined` or cannot be determined during {% url `cy.visit()` visit %}, we now look at the content of the site and evaluate whether it looks like HTML. If it does look like HTML we no longer error and continue as if it the site's `content-type` is `text/html`. {% issue 1727 %} {% issue 773 %} {% issue 3101 %}.
- Visibility errors when window is hidden during headed mode test execution {% issue 4039 %}

- `NO_PROXY` ignored when `baseUrl` is set {% issue 4303 %}
- 'Cannot read property \'replace\' of null' from sanitize-filename err being thrown {% issue 4310 %}
- Cypress no longer incorrectly errors when calling `cy.window().screenshot()`, `cy.window().scrollTo()` or `cy.window().trigger()` in an application with multiple iframes. Fixes {% issue 4396 %}.
- We no longer delay proxied responses with no body with status codes 1xx, 204, 304. This fixes a regression introduced in {% url "3.2.0" changelog#3-2-0 %} where responses with these status codes were delayed when using a proxy. Fixes {% issue 4298 %}.

- Expecting element to be disabled results in maximum call stack size error {% issue 1958 %}
- If the DOM element provided to {% url "`.type()`" type %} is already in focus, Cypress no longer attempts to click on the DOM element. This allows you to call `.focus()` on elements that are focusable, but not necessarily clickable and type into them using `.type()`. Fixes {% issue 3001 %} and {% issue 4420 %}.
- Fixed issue where `window.performance.getEntriesByType` would return `undefined` instead of an array within application code when using {% url "`cy.clock()`" clock %}. Fixes {% issue 3625 %}.
- Cypress now correctly handles `blur` and `focus` events in situations where the browser has lost focus. Fixes {% issue 4039 %}, {% issue 1176 %}, {% issue 1486 %}
- Passing an array of strings to `ignoreTestFiles` no longer causes an error to throw. Fixes {% issue 4312 %}.
