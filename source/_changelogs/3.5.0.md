- Test runs infinitely with combination of async error, 'fail' event, and `done` callback, Cypress hangs up when using `done` within a `before` hook after `cy.request`. `beforeEach` with `done` causes tests to hang indefinitely when `done()` called in `promise.then()`.Mixing `cy.on()`/`cy.once()` with a one-argument `it()` function causes test to hang.
