# 6.3.0

*Released 1/19/2021*

**Features:**

- **You can now test file downloads in Cypress** without the download prompt displaying. Any files downloaded while testing file downloads will be stored in the {% url "`downloadsFolder`" configuration#Downloads %} which is set to `cypress/downloads` by default. The `downloadsFolder` will be deleted before each run unless {% url "`trashAssetsBeforeRuns`" configuration#Downloads %} is set to `false`. Addresses {% issue 949 %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- When an uncaught exception is thrown outside a suite with an `.only`, the error will now correctly display in the Command Log. Fixes {% issue 14455 %}.
- Cypress will no longer crash when no record key is provided to the `--key` flag when followed by other CLI flags. Fixed {% issue 14593 %}.
- Extra screenshots will no longer be taken when tests are retried when there is a failure in an `afterEach` hook. Fixes {% issue 9209 %}.
- Having `waitForAnimations` set to `false` no longer affects whether Cypress fires actions on inner elements. Fixes {% issue 14370 %}.
- We fixed a regression in {% url "5.0.0" changelog-5-0-0 %} that would cause string `CYPRESS_` prefixed env variables containing commas to be parsed as multiple values. Fixes {% issue 8818 %}.
- We fixed a regression in {% url "4.9.0" changelog-4-9-0 %} where asserting `have.value` on an undefined subject would throw an error. Fixes {% issue 14359 %}.

**Misc:**

- We removed several Chrome flags that are no longer supported. Addressed in {% issue 14582 %}.

**Dependency Updates:**

- Replaced deprecated `node-sass` with `sass`. Addressed in {% PR 14415 %}.
- Upgraded `electron` from `11.0.3` to `11.2.0`. Addressed in {% issue 14567 %}.
