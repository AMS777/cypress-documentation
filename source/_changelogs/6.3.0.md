**Features:**

- You can now test file downloads in Cypress without the download prompt displaying. Any files downloaded while testing file downloads will be stored in the {% url `downloadsFolder` configuration#Downloads %} which is set to `cypress/downloads` by default. The `downloadsFolder` will be deleted before each run unless `trashAssetsBeforeRuns` is set to `false`. Addresses {% issue 949 %}.
