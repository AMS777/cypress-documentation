# 4.3.0

*Released 3/30/2020*

**Features:**

- Errors shown in the Test Runner now have a new design. Addresses {% issue 3762 %}.
- Cypress now utilizes source maps (when not explicitly disabled) which are used to display the stack trace of errors shown in the Test Runner. Addresses {% issue 3966 %}.
- We added experimental support for adding `sameSite` values to the objects yielded from {% url "`cy.setCookie()`" setcookie %}, {% url "`cy.getCookie()`" getcookie %}, and {% url "`cy.getCookies()`" getcookies %}. Users can enable this by setting the {% url "`experimentalGetCookiesSameSite`" configuration#Experimental-features %} configuration value to `true`. In Cypress 5, this will be the default. Addresses {% issue 2437 %} and {% issue 5070 %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in {% url "4.2.0" changelog-4-2-0 %} where cypress installation could fail if Git is not installed. Fixes {% issue 6752 %}.
- Fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} where certain HTTP requests could fail with `Parse Error: Invalid header value char` or `Parse Error: Header overflow`. Fixes {% issue 5602 %}.
- Fixed a regression in {% url "4.2.0" changelog-4-2-0 %} where Electron deprecation warnings were printed to stderr in open mode. Fixes {% issue 6750 %}.
- Cookies set with a Domain containing a unknown TLD are now sent along for all requests. For example, a cookie like `foo=bar; Domain=.cypress.test` will now be sent during {% url "cy.request()" request %} to `http://local.cypress.test`. Fixes {% issue 6628 %}.
- Security warnings no longer show in Mac OS when opening Cypress since our application now undergoes notarization from Apple. Fixes {% issue 5791 %}.

- Cypress will no longer crash the process if an empty video chunk is received. Addressed in {% PR 6818 %}.

**Misc:**

- When an assertion involving a DOM element retry fails, it now shows a more sensible DOM object in the diff. Addresses {% issue 6723 %}.
- When an assertion is retried (using {% url "`.should()`" should %}) and fails, it now shows the diff in the `stdout`. Addresses {% issue 6722 %}.
- The previously used spec filter in the Test Runner is now saved and restored for projects without an ID.Addresses {% issue 6739 %}.
- We collect more env information from Travis builds for potential use in the Cypress Dashboard. Addresses {% issue 6808 %}.

- Type added for `tag` property when using Module API. Addresses {% issue 6795 %}.
