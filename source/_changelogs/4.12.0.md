# 4.12.0

*Released 8/3/2020*

**Features:**

- Now you can control whether screenshots are automatically taken on test failure during `cypress run` by setting {% url `screenshotOnRunFailure` configuration#Screenshots %} in your configuration. Addresses {% issue 5029 %}.
- The `pluginsFile` now has access to a readonly `version` property within the `config` object that returns the current Cypress version being run. This will allow plugins to better target specific Cypress versions. Addresses {% issue 6352 %}.
- During `cypress open`, you can now run a subset of all specs by {% url "entering a text search filter and clicking 'Run n tests'" writing-and-organizing-tests#Run-filtered-specs %}. Addresses {% issue 6581 %}.
