# 5.0.0

*Released X/X/2020*

**Summary:**

Cypress now includes support for test retries! Similar to how Cypress will retry assertions when they fail, test retries will allow you to automatically retry a failed test prior to marking it as failed. Read our new guide on Test Retries for more details.
