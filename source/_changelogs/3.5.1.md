# 3.5.1

*Released 10/28/2019*

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} where the maximum size of an HTTP header or body in a stubbed {% url "`cy.route()`" route %} was limited to 8kb causing requests to fail with a 431 HTTP error. Fixes {% issue 5431 %}.
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} that would throw an error during `cypress verify` when running as a non-root user on a non-Windows machine. We now always set the `--no-sandbox` flag when verifying in Electron, even when running as a non-root user. Fixes {% issue 5434 %}.
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} where sometimes cookies were not set on the correct URL during a redirect inside of a {% url "`cy.visit()`" visit %} or {% url "`cy.request()`" request %}. Fixes {% issue 5432 %}.
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} causing environment variables containing unicode values to be incorrectly resolved when read via {% url "`Cypress.env()`" env %}. Fixes {% issue 5435 %}.

**Misc:**

- We no longer log the default option `{multiple: true}` in the Command Log or the console during {% url "`cy.dblclick()`" dblclick %}. Addresses {% issue 5406 %}.
