{% note danger %}
ðŸš¨ Please be aware that `cy.route()` and `cy.server()` only currently supports intercepting XMLHttpRequests. **Requests using the Fetch API and other types of network requests like page loads and `<script>` tags will not be intercepted by `cy.route()` and `cy.server()`.** You can polyfill `window.fetch` to spy on and stub requests using `cy.route()` and `cy.server()` by enabling the [experimental](https://on.cypress.io/experimental) feature `experimentalFetchPolyfill`. See {% issue 95 %} for more details and temporary workarounds.

Cypress also has [`cy.http()`](/api/commands/http.html) that supports requests using the Fetch API and other types of network requests like page loads. For more information, check out the [`cy.http()` documentation](/api/commands/http.html).{% endnote %}
