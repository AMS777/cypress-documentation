- How to extend tests interactively using the Cypress Studio
{% endnote %}

# Overview

Cypress Studio provides users with an easy way to generate tests in the Test Runner,  by interacting with their web app, directly inside the Test Runner.

## Supported Commands

The following Cypress commands are supported. Test code will be generated when interacting with the DOM inside of the Cypress Studio:

- {% url `.click()` click %}
- {% url `.dblclick()` dblclick %}
- {% url `.type()` type %}
- {% url `.select()` select %}


## Using Cypress Studio

The Cypress {% fa fa-github %} {% url "Real World App (RWA)" https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app %} will be use to demo the functionality of Cypress Studio.

## Test Scaffolding

Create a file under `cypress/integration` with the following test scaffolding.

```js
describe('Cypress Studio Demo', function () {
  beforeEach(function () {
    cy.task("db:seed")

    cy.database('find', 'users').then((user) => {
      cy.login(user.username, 's3cret', true)
    });
  })
  it('create new transaction', function () {
    // Extend test with Cypress Studio
  })
  it('create new bank account', function () {
    // Extend test with Cypress Studio
  });
})
```

## Extending a Test

We will use Cypress Studio to perform a New Transaction user journey.

We are logged into the application inside the `beforeEach` block.

Cypress Studio is directly integrated with the {% url 'Command Log' test-runner#Command-Log %}.

First, launch the Test Runner and run the spec created in the previous step.

Once the tests complete the run, hovering over the test in the Command Log will reveal an "Extend Test" button. Clicking on "Extend Test" will launch the Cypress Studio.

Click the "Get Started" button to begin interacting with your site to generate tests.
{% imgTag /img/guides/cypress-studio/extend-test-3.png "Cypress Studio Get Started" "no-border" %}

Next, the Test Runner will execute the test in isolation and pause after the last command in the test.

Now, we can begin updating the test to create a new transaction between users.

To record actions, begin interacting with the application.  Here we will click on the first name input and as a result we will see the click recorded in the Command Log.

Next, we can type the name of a user to pay and click on the user in the results.

{% imgTag /img/guides/cypress-studio/extend-test-6.png "Cypress Studio Extend Test" "no-border" %}


Next, we will complete the transaction form clicking on and typing in the amount and description inputs.  Notice the commands generated in the command log.

Finally, we will click the "Pay" button.
{% imgTag /img/guides/cypress-studio/extend-test-8.png "Cypress Studio Extend Test" "no-border" %}

We are presented with a confirmation page of our new transaction.
