## Introduction

End-to-end (E2E) tests excel at testing complex systems. However, there are still behaviors that are difficult to verify and make tests unintentionally flaky (i.e., unreliable) and fail intermittently due to unpredictable conditions (eg., temporary outages in external dependencies, random network errors, etc.)  Some other common race conditions that could result in unreliable tests include:

- Animations
- API calls
- Test server / database availability
- Resource dependencies availability
- Network issues

With the new test retries feature, Cypress (5.0+) will be able to retry failed tests to help reduce test flakiness and continuous integration (CI) build failures. By doing so, this will save your team valuable time and resources so you can focus on what matters most to you.

## How It Works

As of Cypress 5.0, test retries are on by default in `cypress run` mode. This means that tests will automatically be re-run up to two additional times (for a total of three attempts) before being marked as a failed test. When each test is run again, the following lifecycle hooks will be re-run on each attempt:

- `beforeEach`
- `afterEach`

The following is a detailed step-by-step example of how test retries will work:

1. A test runs for the first time. If it passes, Cypress will move forward with any remaining tests as expected.

2. If the test fails, it will inform users that the first attempt failed and it will attempt to run the test a second time.

3. If the test succeed after the second try, Cypress will continue with any remaining tests.

4. If it fails a second time, it will make the final third attempt to re-run the test.

5. If it fails a third time, Cypress will make the test as failed and then proceed with any remaining tests.

In addition, you will be able to see the number of attempts made in the Command Log and expand each attempt for further inspection and debugging if desired.

## Configuring Test Retries

Starting with Cypress 5.0, if any tests fail, they will be automatically:

- Retried up to two times (for a total of three attempts) in `cypress run` mode
- Run normally with no retries in `cypress open` mode

The reason for this distinction is to avoid wasting developer time by preventing unnecessary runs while a test is being worked on.

If you need more information on how to migrate to 5.x, please see our official migration guide here.

### Global Configuration

If you need to change the number of attempts being made across your entire test suite for both `cypress run` and `cypress open`, you can configure this in your `cypress.json` by defining the `retries` property and giving it the desired number.

```jsx
{
  "retries": 1
}
```

#### Disable Test Retries

If you would like to disable test retries, you can use the global configuration to do so by setting it to 0.

```jsx
{
  "retries": 1
}
```

#### Configuring Specific Retries for Different Modes

However, in the event you need to define unique retry attempts for the different modes of Cypress, you can pass the `retries` option an object with the following options:

- `runMode` allows you to define the number of test retries when running `cypress run`
- `openMode` allows you to define the number of test retries when running `cypress open`

```jsx
{
  "retries": {
    // Configure retries for `cypress run` 
    // Default is 2
    "runMode": 1,
    // Configure retries for `cypress open`
    // Default is 0
    "openMode": 3
  }
}
```

### Custom Configurations

#### Individual Test(s)

In the event a specific test requires a custom number of test retries configured, this can be achieved by using the test's local configuration option.

```jsx
// Customizing retries for an individual test
describe('User sign-up and login', () => {
  // `it` test block with no custom configuration
  it('should redirect unauthenticated user to sign-in page', () => {
    ...
  })

  // `it` test block with custom configuration
  it('allows user to login', { 
    retries: {
      runMode: 3,
      openMode: 2
    }
  }, () => {
    ...
  })
})

```

#### Test Suite(s)

If you want a suite of tests to re-run in requires a custom number of test retries configured, this can be achieved by using the test's local configuration option

```jsx
// Customizing retries for a suite of tests
describe('User bank accounts', {
  retries: {
    runMode: 3,
    openMode: 1,
  }
}, () => {
  // Individual tests will be run normally
  it('allows a user to view their transactions, () => {
    ...
  }

  it('allows a user to edit their transactions, () => {
    ...
  }
})

```

## Assets

With test retries, Cypress will now generate any assets (i.e., screenshots, video recordings, etc.) per each test attempt. The assets will be properly labeled with the attempt number appended at the end of each asset.

## Tips and Strategies

While test retries are great for helping to avoid false negatives from failing an entire test run, it is not a good replacement for writing good tests. As a result, here are some tips and strategies to keep in mind in order to maximize the effectiveness of your tests with test retries:

- If you are noticing that you need to increase the number of retries, this cause is more likely due to how the tests are written and is worth spending the time to investigate
- If you use `Run all specs` a lot in `cypress open` mode, make sure to configure your Cypress instance to have a global `retries` of `2` so you can simulate what is being run in `cypress run` mode.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

#### Will runs with test retries be counted as more than one run?

No. When recording to the Cypress Dashboard, runs with test retries will be counted as a single run.
